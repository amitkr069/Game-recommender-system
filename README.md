# Game-recommending-system
The game recommender system project utilizes a dataset of over 10,000 video games, each described by features such as title, developers, genres, publishers, and ratings, to build a content-based recommendation engine. The system preprocesses the data by combining key metadata into a unified "tags" column, normalizing the text for consistency. Using these tags, it computes similarity between games—likely via cosine similarity on vectorized tag data—to suggest titles that share similar attributes in terms of genre, developer, or publisher. This approach enables the system to recommend games with related content, though it does not incorporate user preferences or collaborative filtering. The project demonstrates effective use of metadata and text processing for scalable, content-based game recommendations, providing a foundation for further enhancements such as personalization or hybrid models.
